# Welcome to the <a href="https://esiil.org/esiil-stars" target="_blank">**ESIIL Stars**</a> Internship 2024! 

We are excited to have you in class for the next 5 months as we introduce you to **Earth and Environmental Data Science (EDS)** fundamentals using <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">**Python**</a>. 

This work represents a partnership between **Oglala Lakota College** (<a href="https://www.olc.edu/" target="_blank">**OLC**</a>), **Metropolitan State University of Denver** (<a href="https://www.msudenver.edu/" target="_blank">**MSU**</a>), **United Tribes Technical College** (<a href="https://uttc.edu/" target="_blank">**UTTC**</a>), and **The Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab** (<a href="https://esiil.org/" target="_blank">**ESIIL**</a>). ESIIL is a part of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (<a href="https://cires.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**CIRES**</a>) a partnership of the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**University of Colorado Boulder**</a> and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">**NOAA**</a>). We are also affiliated with <a href="https://earthlab.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">**Earth Lab**</a>.

## ESIIL is about building an inclusive Earth and Environmental Data Science (EDS) community

ESIIL Stars aims to meet the following objectives through technical training and project based learning: 
  * Train the **next generation** of Earth and Environmental Data Scientists
  * Answer relevant **GIS and Earth/Environmental science** questions
  * **Diversify** the EDS workforce
  * **Build capacity** to teach & learn EDS at partner institutions

***

## Course Schedule (Tentative):
### Spring Training (mid-March through end-of-spring-semester)

ESIIL instructors will meet weekly with each team to answer questions and check-in on interns' progress. We will bring all of the teams together to meet as a large group throughout the spring and summer semesters. 

> ### Spring training will include the following **Big Ideas:**
> * Building your brand with **GitHub Pages**
> * Using **GitHub** for collaborative data science
> * **Open** and **reproducible** science with **Python**
> * **Earth and Environmental Data Science** with **Python**
>   * Tabular and **time-series** data
>   * **Vector** and **raster** spatial data

### Summer Group Projects 
Starting in the summer semester (**early-June**), group projects will begin. From here through the end of the internship (**first week of August**), teams will begin checking-in multiple times per week for regular progress reports, and help sessions for group projects. Each team will be responsible for **designing their own project** to apply the EDS skills learned during the Spring Training. Each team will present their group project during a **final presentation** and in written form through a **project blog post** during the final week of the internship. We will post your presentations and blogs to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@earthlabcuboulder458/featured" target="_blank">**YouTube**</a> channel and other **social media**. We will also discuss **Digital Object Identifiers** (DOI) and other ways to make your work findable and citable.
